# Data Engineering on Microsoft Azure

Welcome to my personal repository for Data Engineering projects and resources on Microsoft Azure. This repository is a collection of code, guides, and resources related to data engineering workflows and solutions using Azure services.

## Introduction

In this repository, I explore various aspects of Data Engineering on Microsoft Azure. From data ingestion and processing to storage and analytics, I'm sharing my experiences and projects to help others learn and apply data engineering concepts in the Azure ecosystem.

<!--- ## Projects

Here are some of the key projects am going to work on:

1. **Azure Data Factory ETL Pipeline:**
   Building an end-to-end ETL pipeline using Azure Data Factory to extract data from multiple sources, transform it, and load it into Azure SQL Data Warehouse.

2. **Real-time Stream Processing with Azure Stream Analytics:**
   Implementing a real-time data processing solution using Azure Stream Analytics to analyze incoming data streams and trigger actions based on conditions.

3. **Data Lake Storage and Databricks Integration:**
   Exploring the integration between Azure Data Lake Storage and Azure Databricks for scalable data processing and analysis.
